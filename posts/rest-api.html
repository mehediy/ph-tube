          What do you mean by REST API?
        </h1>
        <div class="text-justify">
          <p>
            REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer
            Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural
            principles and constraints for designing and building web services.
            REST is not a specific technology or protocol but rather an
            architectural style that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for
            communication. It was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral
            dissertation in 2000 and has since become a widely used approach for
            designing web services due to its simplicity and scalability.
            <br /><br />
            Key characteristics and principles of RESTful APIs include:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mt-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              Stateless: Each request from a client to a server must contain all
              the information needed to understand and process the request. The
              server does not store any information about the client's state
              between requests. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to cache.
            </li>
            <li>
              Resources: In a REST API, resources are the fundamental entities
              that clients can interact with. Resources are identified by unique
              URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can represent objects,
              data, or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              HTTP Methods: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT,
              DELETE, etc.) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
              operations on resources. Each HTTP method has a specific meaning
              in the context of REST:
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>GET: Retrieve resource data.</li>
                <li>POST: Create a new resource.</li>
                <li>PUT: Update an existing resource.</li>
                <li>DELETE: Remove a resource.</li>
                <li>
                  And others (e.g., PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) for more specific
                  operations.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Stateless Communication: Each request from the client to the
              server should contain all necessary information. The server should
              not depend on the client's state or store information about it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Representation: Resources can have multiple representations, such
              as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients can request the representation they
              prefer using the Accept header in the request.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uniform Interface: A uniform and consistent interface simplifies
              the interactions between clients and servers. It includes using
              standard HTTP methods and providing clear and consistent URIs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Layered System: REST allows for a layered architecture, where
              different components (e.g., load balancers, security protocols,
              caching) can be added between clients and servers without
              affecting the overall system.
            </li>
            <li>
              Statelessness: RESTful services are stateless, which means each
              request from a client to a server must contain all the information
              needed to understand and process the request. The server does not
              store any information about the client's state between requests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Client-Server Architecture: REST follows a client-server
              architecture, where the client and server are separate entities
              that communicate over a network. This separation allows for better
              scalability and flexibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cacheability: Responses from the server can be cached by clients
              or intermediary caches, improving performance and reducing server
              load.
