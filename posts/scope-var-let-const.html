          Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </h1>
        <div class="text-justify">
          <p>
            <strong>var, let, and const</strong> are three keywords used for
            declaring variables in JavaScript. Each of these has a different
            scope, which determines where in your code the variable can be
            accessed and how it behaves. Let's discuss the scope of each:
          </p>
          <ol class="list-decimal ml-4 mt-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
            <li>
              var:
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>
                  Function Scope: Variables declared with var are
                  function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within
                  the function in which they are declared.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hoisting: var declarations are hoisted to the top of their
                  containing function or global scope. This means you can access
                  a var variable before it's declared, but it will have an
                  initial value of undefined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No Block Scope: Unlike let and const, var variables are not
                  block-scoped. This means they can "leak" out of block
                  statements like if, for, and while loops.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              let:
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>
                  Block Scope: Variables declared with let are block-scoped,
                  which means they are accessible only within the block (i.e., a
                  pair of curly braces {}) in which they are defined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No Hoisting: Unlike var, let declarations are not hoisted. You
                  cannot access a let variable before it's declared.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              const:
              <ul class="list-disc ml-4">
                <li>
                  Block Scope: Like let, variables declared with const are
                  block-scoped. They are accessible only within the block where
                  they are defined.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Constant Value: Variables declared with const are constants,
                  which means their value cannot be reassigned after
                  initialization. However, for objects and arrays declared with
                  const, the properties or elements inside them can be modified,
                  but the variable itself cannot be reassigned.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
    </main>
